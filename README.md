# OpenFamilySafe

**OpenFamilySafe** is a secure, parent-controlled web proxy interface designed for family safety and content management. It allows parents to provide a safe "tunnel" for their children to access specific web content while maintaining oversight and control.

## 🚀 Overview

The application is built as a **Serverless Hybrid** system. It bypasses the limitations of traditional free-tier hosting by utilizing **Cloudflare Workers** as a proxy backend and **Firebase** for authentication and state management.

### Key Features

*   **Secure Authentication:** Powered by Firebase Auth, supporting both **Sign Up** (Registration) and **Sign In** via Email/Password.
*   **Content Filtering:** Configurable restriction levels (Strict, Moderate, None).
*   **Admin Dashboard:** Parents can approve/reject accounts and toggle filter settings.
*   **Full Screen Mode:** Immersive proxy browsing experience that mimics a native browser window.
*   **Live Demo Mode:** Uses a public CORS gateway to demonstrate real-time web access without requiring immediate backend deployment.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite.
*   **Authentication:** Firebase Auth (Email/Password).
*   **Database:** Firebase Firestore (User profiles & settings).
